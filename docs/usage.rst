Usage
-----

The ``qsiprep`` preprocessing workflow takes as principal input the path of
the dataset that is to be processed. The input dataset is required to be in
valid :abbr:`BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure)` formate at least one
diffusion MRI series. The T1w image and the DWI may be in separate BIDS
<session> folders for a given subject. We highly recommend that you validate
your dataset with the free, online `BIDS Validator
<http://bids-standard.github.io/bids-validator/>`_.

The exact command to run ``qsiprep`` depends on the Installation_ method.
The common parts of the command are similar to the `BIDS-Apps
<https://github.com/BIDS-Apps>`_ definition.

Example: ::

    qsiprep data/bids_root/ out/ participant -w work/


Command-Line Arguments
======================

.. argparse::
   :ref: qsiprep.cli.parser._build_parser
   :prog: qsiprep
   :nodefault:
   :nodefaultconst:


Infant mode
===========

If ``--infant`` is used, the pipeline will select an MNIInfant template with the
appropriate cohort based on the participant's age.

``--infant`` is only compatible with ``--subject-anatomical-reference sessionwise``.

.. note::

    QSIPrep's cohort selection is derived from Nibabies.

Participant Ages
----------------

QSIPrep will attempt to automatically extract participant ages (in months) from the BIDS layout. Specifically, these two files will be checked:

Sessions file: <bids-root>/<subject>/subject_sessions.tsv

Participants file: <bids-root>/participants.tsv

Either file should include age (or if you wish to be more explicit: age_months) columns, and it is recommended to have an accompanying JSON file to further describe these fields, and explicitly state the values are in months.


Note on using CUDA
==================

The CUDA runtime version 9.1 is included in the QSIPrep docker image.
The CUDA version of eddy is dramatically faster than the openmp version.
Information on running Docker with CUDA enabled can be found on
`dockerhub <https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker/wiki/CUDA>`_. If running with Apptainer,
the call to Apptainer should include ``--nv``. To enable CUDA, see :ref:`configure_eddy`.

Debugging
=========

Logs and crashfiles are outputted into the
``<output dir>/qsiprep/sub-<participant_label>/log`` directory.
Information on how to customize and understand these files can be found on the
`nipype debugging <http://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/debug.html>`_
page.

CUDA Support
============

As of version 0.6.7 CUDA version 9.1 is supported in the QSIPrep container! To run locally
using docker you will need the nvidia container runtime installed for Docker version 19.0.3
or higher. Apptainer images will run with CUDA 9.1 with the ``-nv`` flag.
