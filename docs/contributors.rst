This document explains how to prepare a new development environment and
update an existing environment, as necessary.

Development in Docker is encouraged, for the sake of consistency and
portability.
By default, work should be built off of `pennlinc/qsiprep:latest
<https://hub.docker.com/r/pennlinc/qsiprep/>`_ (see the
installation_ guide for the basic procedure for running).


*****************************
Patching working repositories
*****************************

In order to test new code without rebuilding the Docker image, it is
possible to mount working repositories as source directories within the
container.

When invoking ``docker`` directly, the mount options must be specified
with the ``-v`` flag::

    -v $HOME/projects/qsiprep/qsiprep:/usr/local/miniconda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/qsiprep:ro
    -v $HOME/projects/nipype/nipype:/usr/local/miniconda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/nipype:ro

For example, ::

    $ docker run --rm -v $HOME/fullds005:/data:ro -v $HOME/dockerout:/out \
        -v $HOME/projects/qsiprep/qsiprep:/usr/local/miniconda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/qsiprep:ro \
        pennlinc/qsiprep:latest /data /out/out participant \
        -w /out/work/

In order to work directly in the container, use ``--entrypoint=bash``
arguments in a ``docker`` command::

    $ docker run --rm -v $HOME/fullds005:/data:ro -v $HOME/dockerout:/out \
        -v $HOME/projects/qsiprep/qsiprep:/usr/local/miniconda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/qsiprep:ro --entrypoint=bash \
        pennlinc/qsiprep:latest

Patching containers can be achieved in Apptainer analogous to ``docker``
using the ``--bind`` (``-B``) option: ::

    $ apptainer run \
        -B $HOME/projects/qsiprep/qsiprep:/usr/local/miniconda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/qsiprep \
        qsiprep.img \
        /scratch/dataset /scratch/out participant -w /out/work/

Or you can patch Apptainer containers using the PYTHONPATH variable: ::

   $ PYTHONPATH="$HOME/projects/qsiprep" apptainer run qsiprep.img \
        /scratch/dataset /scratch/out participant -w /out/work/


Running tests locally
=====================

To run the tests locally, *QSIRecon* includes a Python script to automatically mount the
local clone into ``pennlinc/qsiprep:unstable`` and run tests with ``pytest``.
The script will also download any required test data from Box.

To run the tests, navigate to the tests folder and run ``run_local_tests.py``::

    $ cd /path/to/qsiprep/qsiprep/tests
    $ python run_local_tests.py

You can select individual tests to run by using the ``-m`` (to select markers) or ``-k`` (the select tests by name) flags::

    $ python run_local_tests.py -m "dsdti_fmap"
    $ python run_local_tests.py -k "test_some_name"

.. warning::

    Please note that the integration tests in *QSIPrep* are computationally intensive
    and may take a long time to run, so be prepared for that before running them on a laptop.


If the tests pass, that's a good sign that your changes are solid.
We also recommend opening the HTML reports produced by integration tests to check the results.
Evaluating whether the HTML reports look "good" requires some domain knowledge and
familiarity with *QSIPrep* outputs.


*******************
Adding dependencies
*******************

New dependencies to be inserted into the Docker image will either be
Python or non-Python dependencies.
Python dependencies may be added in three places, depending on whether
the package is large or non-release versions are required.
The image `must be rebuilt <#rebuilding-docker-image>`_ after any
dependency changes.

Python dependencies should generally be included in the ``REQUIRES``
list in `qsiprep/info.py
<https://github.com/pennlinc/qsiprep/blob/29133e5e9f92aae4b23dd897f9733885a60be311/qsiprep/info.py#L46-L61>`_.
If the latest version in `PyPI <https://pypi.org/>`_ is sufficient,
then no further action is required.

For large Python dependencies where there will be a benefit to
pre-compiled binaries, `conda <https://github.com/conda/conda>`_ packages
may also be added to the ``conda install`` line in the `Dockerfile
<https://github.com/pennlinc/qsiprep/blob/29133e5e9f92aae4b23dd897f9733885a60be311/Dockerfile#L46>`_.

Non-Python dependencies must also be installed in the Dockerfile, via a
``RUN`` command.
For example, installing an ``apt`` package may be done as follows: ::

    RUN apt-get update && \
        apt-get install -y <PACKAGE>


***********************
Rebuilding Docker image
***********************

If it is necessary to rebuild the Docker image, a local image named
``qsiprep`` may be built from within the working qsiprep
repository, located in ``~/projects/qsiprep``: ::

    ~/projects/qsiprep$ docker build -t qsiprep .

To work in this image, replace ``pennlinc/qsiprep:latest`` with
``qsiprep`` in any of the above commands.


***********************************************
Adding new features to the citation boilerplate
***********************************************

The citation boilerplate is built by adding two dunder attributes
of workflow objects: ``__desc__`` and ``__postdesc__``.
Once the full *QSIPrep* workflow is built, starting from the
outer workflow and visiting all sub-workflows in topological
order, all defined ``__desc__`` are appended to the citation
boilerplate before descending into sub-workflows.
Once all the sub-workflows of a given workflow have
been visited, then the ``__postdesc__`` attribute is appended
and the execution pops out to higher level workflows.
The dunder attributes are written in Markdown language, and may contain
references.
To add a reference, just add a new Bibtex entry to the references
database (``/qsiprep/data/boilerplate.bib``).
You can then use the Bibtex handle within the Markdown text.
For example, if the Bibtex handle is ``myreference``, a citation
will be generated in Markdown language with ``@myreference``.
To generate citations with parenthesis and/or additional content,
brackets should be used: e.g. ``[see @myreference]`` will produce
a citation like *(see Doe J. et al 2018)*.


An example of how this works is shown here::

    workflow = Workflow(name=name)
    workflow.__desc__ = """\
    Head-motion parameters with respect to the DWI reference
    (transformation matrices, and six corresponding rotation and translation
    parameters) are estimated before any spatiotemporal filtering using
    `mcflirt` [FSL {fsl_ver}, @mcflirt].
    """.format(fsl_ver=fsl.Info().version() or '<ver>')
