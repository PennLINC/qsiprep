# What's New

## 1.0.0rc1

This is a prerelease for the version that will be used by the HBCD project for their first data release.
Starting with this release, QSIPrep is now being deployed to `pennlinc/qsiprep`
on DockerHub instead of `pennbbl/qsiprep`.

We plan to not introduce any backwards-incompatible changes for a while.

### üõ† Breaking Changes

* Replace pennbbl with pennlinc in package by @tsalo in https://github.com/PennLINC/qsiprep/pull/869

## 0.21.1 (Apr 25, 2024)

There are important software updates in this release, along with a lot of infrastructure improvements.

### Important Changes

* FSL version 6.0.7.8 is now in qsiprep. This contains 2 [serious bugfixes](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/docs/#/development/history/changelog-6.0.7.8.md). One has to do with susceptibility-by-volume correction and the other resulted in incorrect CNR values being calculated.
* DSI Studio has been updated to fix a bug in [Neighboring DWI Correlation](https://github.com/frankyeh/DSI-Studio/issues/84).
* You can use `"mporder"` in your eddy config json file and the slice timings will automatically be created and passed to eddy (even if you're concatenating runs)
* Recon workflows can now include a "bundle mapping" and "scalar mapping", where scalars created in individual workflows can be mapped to a template or summarized inside autotrack bundles. This does not do tract profiles or surface mapping - yet. See `qsiprep/data/pipelines/hbcd_scalar_maps.json` for an example.
* The recon derivatives are written approximately according to BEP-016

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/PennLINC/qsiprep/compare/0.17.0...0.18.0alpha0


## 0.16.1 (October 10, 2022)

Adds a critical fix for ABCD-style acquisitions (described in #449). This change forces
TOPUP to use the raw, unprocessed b=0 images from the DWI series and the epi fieldmaps to
estimate distortion. Previously, the most-denoised version of each image was used in
TOPUP. To disable this change and return to the previous behavior, use the
`--denoised-image-sdc` flag.

Note, **this is a change in the default behavior of QSIPrep!!**

### Upgrades

* Update ITK to 5.3, update ANTs #449
* Add `--denoised-image-sdc` #465

### Bug fixes

* Use safe_load instead of load for yaml #443
* Add fugue and prelude back to the qsiprep image #463


## 0.16.0RC2 (June 1, 2022)

* Adds multithreading to connectome2tck #429


## 0.16.0RC2 (June 1, 2022)

Fixes a naming error in the schaefer 400 atlas #428


## 0.16.0RC1 (May 30, 2022)

Major additions to the reconstruction workflows! Most notably PyAFQ is available
as a reconstruction workflow. The default atlases included in QSIPrep have been
updated to include subcortical regions if they weren't already present in the
original atlas.

* Add PyAFQ reconstruction workflows #398 Credit: @36000
* Make sure all recon workflows respect omp_nthreads #368
* Add DKI derivatives #371
* Properly transform 4D CNR images from Eddy #393
* Update amico to version 22.4.1 #394
* Fix concatenation bug #403 credit: @cookpa
* Prevent divide by zero error #405 credit: @cookpa
* Critical Fix, use correct transform to get atlases into T1w space #417
* Add resampled atlases back into derivatives #418
* Add connectome2tck exemplar streamlines for mrtrix connectivity workflows #420
* Update the atlases to include subcortical regions #426 [details here](https://github.com/PennLINC/qsiprep-atlas/blob/main/QSIRecon%20atlases.ipynb)


## 0.15.2 (March 3, 2022) DEPRECATED

**WARNING** There is an bug in the connectome pipelines that makes the connectivity
matrices unreliable. Do not use this version for connectome estimation.

Due to persistent difficulties with crashing ODF plots in the reconstruction workflows,
there is now a `--skip-odf-reports` option that will disable the ODF and peak plots
in the html reports. This should only be used once you've run some test workflows
with the reports still enabled, so you know that your ODFs are correctly oriented.

* Make ODF Plots optional (#364)
* Bugfix: ABCD gradient data for extrapolation (#363)
* Adds `dipy_dki` reconstruction workflow (#366)


## 0.15.1 (February 28, 2022) DEPRECATED

**WARNING** There is an bug in the connectome pipelines that makes the connectivity
matrices unreliable. Do not use this version for connectome estimation.

A lot of changes in QSIPrep. The big-picture changes are

 1. The build system was redone so a multistage build is used in a
    different repository (https://github.com/PennLINC/qsiprep_build).
    The container should be about half as big as the last release.
 2. The way anatomical masks are handled in reconstruction workflows
    has been changed so that FreeSurfer data can be incorporated.
 3. FAST-based anatomically-constrained tractography is now deprecated in
    QSIPrep. If you're going to use anatomical constraints, they should be
    very accurate. The hybrid surface-volume segmentation (HSVS) is
    *amazing* and should be considered the default way to use the
    MRtrix3/3Tissue workflows. The
    [documentation](https://qsiprep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reconstruction.html)
    describes the new built-in workflow names.
 4. The reconstruction workflows have been totally refactored. This won't
    affect the outputs of the reconstruction workflows, but will affect
    anyone who is using intermediate files from the working directory.
    The working directories no longer have those unfortunate `..`'s in
    their names.
 5. FSL is updated to 6.0.5.1!

Since these are a lot of changes, please be vigilant and check your results!
The QSIPrep preprocessing workflows have not changed with this release, but
the dependencies have been upgraded for almost everything.

* Fixed bug in sentry interaction


## 0.6.2, 0.6.3RC1, 0.6.3RC2 (October 27, 2019)

* Bugfix: masking was not working on eddy.
* Bugfix: static versioning was not workign in the container.
* New graphics in the documentation.
* Use BSpline Interpolation if --output-resolution is higher than the input resolution.


## 0.6.0RC1, 0.6.2 (October 13, 2019)

An issue was discovered in how voxel orientation interacts with TOPUP/eddy and outside
fieldmaps. Unless everything is in LAS+ prior to going into TOPUP/eddy, the warps are
incorrectly applied at the end of eddy. This resulted in fieldmap unwarping reports that
looked good but a final output that is bizarrely warped. Additionally, GRE fieldmaps would
result in outputs being under-unwarped. To fix all of these, TOPUP (if PEPOLAR fieldmaps are
being used) and eddy occur in LAS+, then their outputs are converted to LPS+ for GRE fieldmaps,
SyN. The rest of the pipeline happens in LPS+, like the SHORELine version.

* Update installation method to match fMRIPrep
* Add CI tests for reconstruction workflows
* Make the ``--sloppy`` option affect the reconstruction workflows
* Fixes bug in 3dSHORE reconstruction (incorrect scaling)
* CRITICAL bug fix: convert everything to LAS+ if eddy is going to be used
* Added built-in reconstruction workflows
* Added Brainnetome, AICHA and the remaining Schaefer atlases


## 0.5.1, 0.5.1a, 0.5.2 (September 10, 2019)

* Address issues in Nipype causing random crashes


## 0.5.0 (August 11, 2019)

* Use antsMultiVariateTemplateConstruction2.sh to make a b=0 template across scan groups
* Control the number of template iterations and deformation model with
``--intramodal_template_iters`` and ``--intramodal_template_transform``.


## 0.4.6 (July 23, 2019)

* More documentation updates
* MSD calculated for MAPMRI


## 0.4.5 (July 22, 2019)

* Scalar outputs from MAPMRI


## 0.4.4 (July 19, 2019)

* Default eddy configuation changed to not use CUDA by default.
* Valerie added content to documentation


## 0.4.3 (July 18, 2019)

FSL tools are used to match SHORELine motion parameters to those from eddy.

* Fieldcoefs are calculated from PEPOLAR and GRE fieldmaps and sent to TOPUP
* Motion estimates from SHORELine match eddy


## 0.4.0 (June 7, 2019)

Add workflows for eddy and TOPUP.

* Adds eddy tests on CircleCI.
