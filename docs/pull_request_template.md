Text in these brackets are comments, and won't be visible when you submit your pull request.

A pull request is a conversation. We may ask you to make some changes
before accepting your PR, and likewise, you should feel free to ask us any
questions you have.

We ask you to read through the Contributing Guide:
https://github.com/pennbbl/qsiprep/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

Please take the time to read these, especially if this is your first
contribution.

To boil it down, here are some highlights:

1) Consider starting a conversation in the issues list before submitting a
pull request. The discussion might save you a lot of time coding.
2) Please use descriptive prefixes in your pull request title, such as
"ENH:" for an enhancement or "FIX:" for a bug fix. (See the Contributing guide
for the full set.) And consider adding a "WIP" tag for works-in-progress.
3) Any code you submit will be licensed under the same terms (BSD 3-Clause) as
the rest of qsiprep.
