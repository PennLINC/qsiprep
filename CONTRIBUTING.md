# Contributing to qsiprep

Welcome to the qsiprep repository! We're excited you're here and want to contribute.

## Practical guide to submitting your contribution

These guidelines are designed to make it as easy as possible to get involved. If you have any questions that aren't discussed below, please let us know by opening an [issue][link_issues]!

Before you start you'll need to set up a free [GitHub][link_github] account and sign in. Here are some [instructions][link_signupinstructions].

### Labels

The current list of labels are [here][link_labels] and include:

* [![Help Wanted](https://img.shields.io/badge/-help%20wanted-159818.svg)][link_helpwanted] *These issues contain a task that a member of the team has determined we need additional help with.*

    If you feel that you can contribute to one of these issues, we especially encourage you to do so!

* [![Bugs](https://img.shields.io/badge/-bugs-fc2929.svg)][link_bugs] *These issues point to problems in the project.*

    If you find new a bug, please give as much detail as possible in your issue, including steps to recreate the error.
    If you experience the same bug as one already listed, please add any additional information that you have as a comment.

* [![Feature](https://img.shields.io/badge/-feature-0052cc.svg)][link_feature] *These issues are asking for new features to be added to the project.*

    Please try to make sure that your requested feature is distinct from any others that have already been requested or implemented.
    If you find one that's similar but there are subtle differences please reference the other request in your issue.

## Making a change

We appreciate all contributions to qsiprep, but those accepted fastest will follow a workflow similar to the following:

**1. Comment on an existing issue or open a new issue referencing your addition.**

This allows other members of the qsiprep development team to confirm that you aren't 
overlapping with work that's currently underway and that everyone is on the same page
with the goal of the work you're going to carry out.

[This blog][link_pushpullblog] is a nice explanation of why putting this work in up front is so useful to everyone involved.

**2. [Fork][link_fork] the [qsiprep repository][link_qsiprep] to your profile.**

This is now your own unique copy of qsiprep.
Changes here won't effect anyone else's work, so it's a safe space to explore edits to the code!

Make sure to [keep your fork up to date][link_updateupstreamwiki] with the master repository.

**3. Make the changes you've discussed, following the [qsiprep coding style guide][link_style_guide].**

Try to keep the changes focused. If you feel tempted to "branch out" then please make a [new branch][link_branches].
It can also be helpful to test your changes locally, using an [qsiprep development environment][link_devel].

**4. Submit a [pull request][link_pullrequest].**

A member of the development team will review your changes to confirm that they can be merged into the main codebase.

Pull requests titles should begin with a descriptive prefix:

* ``ENH``: enhancements or new features
* ``FIX``: bug fixes
* ``TST``: new or updated tests
* ``DOC``: new or updated documentation
* ``STY``: style changes
* ``REF``: refactoring existing code
* ``CI``: updates to continous integration infrastructure
* ``MAINT``: general maintenance

For example: `[ENH] Support for SB-reference in multi-band datasets`

For works-in-progress, add the ``WIP`` tag in addition to the descriptive prefix.
Pull-requests tagged with ``[WIP]`` will not be merged until the tag is removed.

## qsiprep coding style guide

Whenever possible, instances of Nodes and Workflows should use the same names
as the variables they are assigned to.
This makes it easier to relate the content of the working directory to the code
that generated it when debugging.

Workflow variables should end in `_wf` to indicate that they refer to Workflows
and not Nodes.
For instance, a workflow whose basename is `myworkflow` might be defined as
follows:

```Python
from nipype.pipeline import engine as pe

myworkflow_wf = pe.Workflow(name='myworkflow_wf')
```

If a workflow is generated by a function, the name of the function should take
the form `init_<basename>_wf`:

```Python
def init_myworkflow_wf(name='myworkflow_wf):
    workflow = pe.Workflow(name=name)
    ...
    return workflow

myworkflow_wf = init_workflow_wf(name='myworkflow_wf')
```

If multiple instances of the same workflow might be instantiated in the same
namespace, the workflow names and variables should include either a numeric
identifier or a one-word description, such as:

```Python
myworkflow0_wf = init_workflow_wf(name='myworkflow0_wf')
myworkflow1_wf = init_workflow_wf(name='myworkflow1_wf')

# or

myworkflow_lh_wf = init_workflow_wf(name='myworkflow_lh_wf')
myworkflow_rh_wf = init_workflow_wf(name='myworkflow_rh_wf')
```
