      b=0 template and final mask output. The t1 and signal intersection mask is blue,
      their xor is red and the entire mask is plotted in cyan.

    subtitle: Susceptibility distortion correction
    caption: |
      Results of performing susceptibility distortion correction (SDC) on the EPI.
  - bids: {datatype: figures, suffix: forcedsyn}
    subtitle: Experimental fieldmap-less susceptibility distortion correction
    caption: |
      The dataset contained some fieldmap information, but the argument <code>--force-syn</code> was used.
      The higher-priority SDC method was used.
      Here, we show the results of performing SyN-based SDC on the EPI for comparison.

    subtitle: DWI Summary
    caption: |
      Summary statistics are plotted, which may reveal trends or artifacts in the DWI data.
      Global signals calculated within the whole-brain (GS),
      within the white-matter (WM) and within cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) show the mean DWI signal in their
      corresponding masks.
      DVARS and FD show the standardized DVARS and framewise-displacement measures for each time point.
      <br />
      A carpet plot shows the time series for all voxels within the brain mask.
      Voxels are grouped into cortical (blue), and subcortical (orange) gray matter,
      cerebellum (green) and white matter and CSF (red), indicated by the color map on the left-hand side.
