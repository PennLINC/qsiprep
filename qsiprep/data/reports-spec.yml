      Inhomogeneities of the <em>B<sub>0</sub></em> field introduce (oftentimes severe) spatial distortions
      along the phase-encoding direction of the image. Some scanners produce a <em>B<sub>0</sub></em>
      mapping of the field, using Spiral Echo Imaging (SEI) or postprocessing a "phase-difference"
      acquisition. The plot below shows an anatomical "magnitude" reference and the corresponding
      fieldmap.

      Inhomogeneities of the <em>B<sub>0</sub></em> field introduce (oftentimes severe) spatial distortions
      along the phase-encoding direction of the image. A Gradient-Recalled Echo (GRE) scheme was included for the
      mapping of the <em>B<sub>0</sub></em> inhomogeneities by subtracting the phase maps obtained at
      two subsequent echoes. The plot below shows an anatomical "magnitude" reference and the corresponding
      fieldmap.

      Inhomogeneities of the <em>B<sub>0</sub></em> field introduce (oftentimes severe) spatial distortions
      along the phase-encoding direction of the image. Utilizing two or more images with different
      phase-encoding polarities (PEPolar) or directions, it is possible to estimate the inhomogeneity
      of the field. The plot below shows a reference EPI (echo-planar imaging) volume generated
      using two or more EPI images with varying phase-encoding blips.

      Inhomogeneities of the <em>B<sub>0</sub></em> field introduce (oftentimes severe) spatial distortions
      along the phase-encoding direction of the image. Utilizing an <em>anatomically-correct</em> acquisition
      (for instance, T1w or T2w), it is possible to estimate the inhomogeneity of the field by means of nonlinear
      registration. The plot below shows a reference EPI (echo-planar imaging) volume generated
      using two or more EPI images with the same PE encoding, after alignment to the anatomical scan.

    caption: |
      Estimated fieldmap, as reconstructed on the target DWI run space to allow
      the assessment of its alignment with the distorted data.
      The anatomical reference is the fieldmap's reference moved into the target EPI's grid through
      the estimated transformation.
      In other words, this plot should be equivalent to that of the
      <em>Preprocessed estimation with varying Phase-Encoding (PE) blips</em> shown above in the
      fieldmap section.
      Therefore, the fieldmap should be positioned relative to the anatomical reference exactly
      as it is positioned in the reportlet above.
