Welcome, new contributors!

We ask you to read through the Contributing Guide:
https://github.com/pennlinc/aslprep/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

These are guidelines intended to make communication easier by describing a consistent process, but
don't worry if you don't get it everything exactly "right" on the first try.

To boil it down, here are some highlights:

1) Consider starting a conversation in the issues list before submitting a pull request. The discussion might save you a
   lot of time coding.
2) Please use descriptive prefixes in your pull request title, such as "ENH:" for an enhancement or "FIX:" for a bug fix.
   (See the Contributing guide for the full set.) And consider adding a "WIP" tag for works-in-progress.
3) Any code you submit will be licensed under the same terms (BSD 3-Clause) as the rest of ASLPrep.

A pull request is a conversation. We may ask you to make some changes before accepting your PR,
and likewise, you should feel free to ask us any questions you have.
